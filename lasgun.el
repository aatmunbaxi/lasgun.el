;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; At its core, lasgun provides avy-backed marking of multiple positions
;;; in the current buffer. The hope is that users can plug this functionality
;;; into wherever they'd like, without shipping an opinonated final product
;;; that shoehorns a particular usage (teach a man to fish or whatever).
